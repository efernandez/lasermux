lasermux
========

This package contains `lasermux`, a node that combines input from multiple,
possibly not fixed `LaserScan` publishers into another `LaserScan` topic,
usually attached to a fixed frame.

This will emulate a virtual laser range scanner for cases where multiple and/or
not fixed laser range scanners have to be used with, for example, the
ROS navigation stack.
